A lightweight SwiftUI library that brings UIKit's interactive pop gesture control to SwiftUI navigation. Easily disable the swipe-back gesture on specific views in your navigation stack.

## üéØ Problem

SwiftUI's `NavigationStack` and `NavigationView` don't provide a native way to disable the interactive pop gesture (swipe-back) on specific views. This can be problematic when you have:

- Forms with unsaved changes
- Multi-step processes that shouldn't be interrupted
- Custom navigation flows
- Views that need to prevent accidental back navigation

## ‚ú® Solution

PopGestureRecognizerSwiftUI bridges the gap by accessing the underlying `UINavigationController` and controlling its `interactivePopGestureRecognizer` property through a simple SwiftUI view modifier.

## üì± Features

- **Simple API**: Just add `.swipeBackGestureDisabled()` to any view
- **Consecutive Support**: Works with multiple consecutive disabled views
- **Smart State Management**: Automatically re-enables gesture when navigating back to enabled views
- **iOS 16+ Compatible**: Built for modern SwiftUI apps
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead and dependencies

## üöÄ Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add PopGestureRecognizerSwiftUI to your project through Xcode:

1. Go to **File ‚Üí Add Package Dependencies**
2. Enter the repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/hayek/PopGestureRecognizerSwiftUI
   ```
3. Select the version and add to your target

Or add it to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/hayek/PopGestureRecognizerSwiftUI", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

Import the library and add the modifier to any view where you want to disable the swipe-back gesture:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import PopGestureRecognizerSwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            VStack {
                NavigationLink("Go to Protected View", destination: ProtectedView())
            }
            .navigationTitle("Home")
        }
    }
}

struct ProtectedView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Swipe back is disabled on this view!")
            .navigationTitle("Protected")
            .swipeBackGestureDisabled() // üéØ This disables swipe back
    }
}
```

## üîç How It Works

The library works by:

1. **Finding the UINavigationController**: Uses `UIKitNavigationWrapper` to locate the underlying navigation controller
2. **State Tracking**: Maintains navigation state for each view controller using `NavigationStateStore`
3. **Gesture Control**: Disables/enables `interactivePopGestureRecognizer` based on view lifecycle
4. **Smart Cleanup**: Automatically cleans up state when views are deallocated
